# Revenue Visibility Diagnostic: Solving the "Profitable Paradox"
**Sector:** High-End Construction & Hurricane-Rated Installations (Florida)  
**Role:** Junior BI Consultant / Operations Architect  

## Project Overview
I was brought in to lead a financial turnaround for a field-service contractor generating $300k+ in annual cash flow. Despite high-end commercial contracts and flawless technical execution, the business suffered from a "Profitable Paradox"—consistent revenue on paper, but recurring cash-flow stress.

## The Challenge: Digital Archaeology
The business operated in a data vacuum where operational events (labor paid, work performed) were disconnected from financial artifacts (invoices, deposits). 
* **The Mess:** Unreconciled QuickBooks, 2,000+ unorganized email threads, and fragmented payroll logs.
* **The Mission:** Reconstruct the financial reality of Q4 2025 to prove the business was stable enough for a formal line of credit.

## Strategic Intervention
Instead of "doing the books," I performed a **Revenue Visibility Diagnostic**:
1. **The Cash Truth:** Used payroll data as the anchor to map labor costs back to specific projects.
2. **Evidence-First Reconciliation:** Scoured thousands of emails to link "site approvals" to "orphan invoices."
3. **The Job ID Spine:** Engineered a traceability system that ties every labor hour to an invoice and an email approval.

## Key Deliverables
* **[Final Case Study PDF](./Final_Draft-A&M_Case_Study.pdf):** A comprehensive diagnostic brief detailing the "Structural Leaks" and the path to bankability.
* **Stakeholder Presentation:** https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tUm41YtR7kIxJGZdGO7_3XjmTv4GLTiT/view?usp=drive_link - A video walkthrough presenting these high-stakes findings to the owner.

## Outcomes
* **Bankability:** Transformed the company from "Relationship-Driven" to a "Defensible Asset" ready for formal financing.
* **EBITDA Protection:** Identified labor-funded receivables—stopping the business from acting as an interest-free lender to its clients.
* **Systemic Control:** Established a "Decision Gate" for new invoices to ensure traceability never breaks again.

“The business does not need more work to stabilize. It needs traceability and books that are defensible.”
